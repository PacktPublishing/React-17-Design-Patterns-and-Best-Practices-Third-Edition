## What is this book about?
React is an open-source, adaptable JavaScript library for building complex user interfaces (UIs) from small, detached bits called components. This book will help you to use React effectively to make your applications more flexible, easier to maintain, and improve their performance, while giving your workflow a huge boost by improving speed without affecting quality.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Become well-versed with new React features such as context API and React Hooks
* Get to grips with the techniques of styling and optimizing React components
* Make components communicate with each other by applying consolidated patterns
* Use server-side rendering to make applications load faster
* Write a comprehensive set of tests to create robust and maintainable code
